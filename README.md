## Hello there!

I work as a AL Developer, but I'm also studying Computer Engineering in UOC (Universidad Oberta de Catalunya). As such:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Business Central (AL) and Navision (C/AL) projects.
- 🌱 At the moment, I'm learning about (more) AL and computer engineering. I'm also working on the GitHub Education Learning Paths.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on... something. Still unsure on how to collaborate in GitHub, but we are getting there.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with... not sure yet.
- 💬 Ask me about Business Central/Navision (AL and/or C/AL). I have a physics background, so perhaps I can help out in physics and math.
- 📫 How to reach me: through GitHub, of course!
- 🌍 You can also reach out in Spanish!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: "Sí is not an option". Those who know, know ;)
